🏆 WE DID IT! FIRST PLACE AT DISTRICT RO📖 Full Story & Tech Details:CS COMPETITION! 🥇

I'm Adarasha Gaihre, and I can barely contain my excitement... Team Glacier just won FIRST PLACE at District-Level Robotics Competition 2025! 🎉

📸 Sharing our winning certificate with this post! 🏆

🎯 THE WINNING MOMENT:
When judges tested our flood detection system and saw automatic gates open in response to water levels, one said: "This could actually save lives in our communities." That made all the late nights worth it.

🏅 COMPETITION DETAILS:
• Event: District Robotics Competition (Sikhshya Expo-2082)
• Date: 23rd Shrawan, 2082 BS (Aug 8, 2025)
• Venue: Siddhartha Cottage, Butwal
• Organizers: Corner Technology & Chiya Bagan
• Prize: Rs. 20,000 + Gold Medal + Certificate

💪 WHAT MADE US WIN:
✅ Live demo: Water sensors → Automatic flood gates
✅ Judges accessed our web dashboard on their phones
✅ Professional presentation of real-world impact
✅ Open-source commitment for community benefit

� ALERT SYSTEM DETAILS:
• Yellow Alert: Siren + yellow lights + dam gates half-open
• Red Alert: Continuous sirens + red lights + dam gates fully open + underground drainage activated!
• Underground water discharge inspired by Japan's tsunami prevention tunnels - our 3rd servo opens underground channels to suck water away!

�😅 COMPETITION DAY DRAMA:
• Power supply failed 30 mins before demo → switched to power bank backup!
• Venue WiFi blocked our server → mobile hotspot saved us!
• Servos hit mechanical limits → recalibrated to 70° on the spot!

When they announced "First Place: Team Glacier!" - months of 6AM-9PM coding sessions in college classrooms finally paid off! 

🙏 MASSIVE THANKS:
• Our incredible team of hardware wizards & code masters
• Nepathya College for economic & emotional support
• Vice-Principal Shiva Bhattarai sir - drove our project to venue in his personal car & treated us to food!
• Corner Tech (CEO: Ramit Neupane) & Chiya Bagan (MD: Gaurav Kshetri)

🌟 WHAT'S NEXT:
This Rs. 20,000 goes directly into system improvements and real community deployment. The real prize? Building technology that saves lives during Nepal's flood season.
