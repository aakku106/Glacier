## Water Sensor Calibration System

### Problem Statement

ESP32 analog pins are highly sensitive and act as antennas when no sensor is connected, leading to:

- **Ghost Readings:** False water level detection from hand proximity
- **Electromagnetic Interference:** Electrical signals from human body causing false alerts
- **Demonstration Issues:** Unpredictable sensor behavior during indoor presentations
- **System Reliability:** False flood alerts undermining system credibility

### Solution Architecture

The system implements automatic baseline calibration with intelligent noise filtering:

```cpp
// Calibration Variables
int baselineWaterLevel = 0;      // Baseline reading when no sensor connected
bool sensorCalibrated = false;   // Calibration status flag

// Calibration Process (During Setup)
void calibrateWaterSensor() {
    // Take 50 readings to establish baseline
    long sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
        sum += analogRead(WATER_SENSOR_PIN);
        delay(20);
    }
    baselineWaterLevel = sum / 50;
    sensorCalibrated = true;
}

// Real-time Filtering (During Loop)
int getCalibratedWaterLevel(int rawReading) {
    if (baselineWaterLevel > 500) {  // No real sensor detected
        int difference = rawReading - baselineWaterLevel;
        if (abs(difference) < 200) {
            return 0;  // Filter out noise
        }
        return max(0, difference);
    }
    return rawReading;  // Real sensor connected
}
```

### Calibration Logic

1. **Startup Calibration:** System takes 50 analog readings over 1 second
2. **Baseline Establishment:** Average reading becomes the noise baseline
3. **Sensor Detection:**
   - Baseline < 100: Real water sensor connected
   - Baseline > 500: No sensor, use filtering
4. **Noise Filtering:** Only changes >200 from baseline considered valid
5. **Real-time Processing:** Every loop cycle applies calibration to raw readings

### Dashboard Integration

The web interface displays comprehensive calibration information:

- **Calibrated Reading:** Filtered value used for flood detection
- **Raw Signal:** Actual analog value (shows interference)
- **Baseline Value:** Reference point for noise filtering
- **Visual Indicators:** Color-coded status based on calibrated readings
- **Calibration Status:** Clear explanation of filtering system

### Benefits Achieved

- ✅ **Eliminates False Alerts:** No more flood warnings from touching ESP32
- ✅ **Maintains Sensitivity:** Real water changes still detected accurately
- ✅ **Professional Demonstrations:** Predictable, reliable sensor behavior
- ✅ **User Education:** Clear display helps users understand system behavior
- ✅ **Automatic Operation:** No manual calibration required

## Admin Panel Security System

### Authentication Architecture

The system implements a secure, session-based authentication system for administrative access:

````cpp
### Admin Panel Security System

#### Authentication Architecture

The system implements a secure, session-based authentication system for administrative access:

```cpp
// Security Configuration
const String adminPassword = "@1234";           // Admin access password
bool adminAuthenticated = false;                // Authentication state
unsigned long adminSessionStart = 0;            // Session start timestamp
const unsigned long adminSessionTimeout = 600000; // 10-minute session timeout
````

#### Security Features

- **Password Protection:** Simple password-based authentication using "@1234"
- **Session Management:** 10-minute automatic timeout for security
- **Server-Side Session Invalidation:** Secure logout that properly terminates sessions
- **Real-time Session Validation:** Automatic session checking every 30 seconds
- **Session Timeout Detection:** Automatic redirect when sessions expire
- **Authentication Validation:** All admin functions require valid session
- **Security Logging:** Admin actions are logged with timestamps
- **Professional UI:** Gradient login interface with auto-focus password field
- **Error Handling:** Clear feedback for invalid passwords and expired sessions

#### Secure Logout Implementation

**Critical Security Fix:** The logout system now properly invalidates sessions server-side to prevent unauthorized access:

```cpp
void handleAdminLogout() {
  // Invalidate the session on server side
  adminAuthenticated = false;
  adminSessionStart = 0;

  addToLogFormatted("ADMIN", "🚪 Admin session terminated - User logged out", "INFO");

  // Redirect to main dashboard
  server.sendHeader("Location", "/");
  server.send(302, "text/plain", "Logged out successfully");
}

void handleAdminSessionCheck() {
  // Check if admin session is valid
  if (!adminAuthenticated || (millis() - adminSessionStart > adminSessionTimeout)) {
    adminAuthenticated = false; // Ensure session is invalidated
    server.send(401, "application/json", "{"authenticated":false,"message":"Session expired"}");
    return;
  }
