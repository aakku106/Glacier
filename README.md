## üéØ **Project Overview**

The **Glacier Flood Detection System** is an intelligent early warning system designed to protect communities from sudden glacier flood events. Using advanced IoT sensors and real-time monitoring, our system provides critical flood warnings and automated flood gate controls.

### üö® **The Problem We Solved**

- **Primary Focus:** Sudden catastrophic floods threatening communities
- **Secondary Challenge:** Glacier melting causes rapid water level changes
- Communities near water bodies lack early warning systems
- Traditional flood detection is too slow for emergency response
- Manual flood gate operation is dangerous during disasters
- **Remote Areas:** Landslides block rescue access in hilly regions of Nepal
- **Communication Issues:** WiFi unreliable in mountainous terrain

### üí° **Our Complete Solution**

A comprehensive disaster management system that:

- ‚úÖ **Detects floods instantly** with calibrated water level sensors
- ‚úÖ **Monitors glacier conditions** using RFID simulation (backup method after hardware issues)
- ‚úÖ **Warns communities immediately** via web dashboard and audio/visual alerts
- ‚úÖ **Controls flood gates automatically** using 3 servo motors
- ‚úÖ **Provides real-time data** through WiFi IoT connectivity
- ‚úÖ **Enables remote rescue operations** with dual-connectivity RC cars
- ‚úÖ **Ensures reliable communication** with WiFi + Bluetooth backup systems
