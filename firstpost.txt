🌊 Introducing "Glacier" - Our IoT Flood Detection & Prevention System 🚨

Hi, I'm Adarasha Gaihre! As CS students at Nepathya College, we built something that could save lives in Nepal - a smart flood detection system that automatically warns communities and prevents disasters.

🎯 THE PROBLEM:
Every monsoon, sudden floods devastate Nepal's communities. People near rivers get no warning until it's too late.

💡 OUR SOLUTION:
✅ Real-time water sensors with smart calibration
✅ Automated flood gates (3 servo motors)
✅ WiFi web dashboard for remote monitoring  
✅ Two-level alerts: Yellow → Red
✅ Open-source for global deployment

� KEY INNOVATIONS:
• ESP32 + Arduino dual-power architecture
• Filters false readings (touching sensor won't trigger alerts!)
• RFID glacier simulation for safe demos
• Works 24/7 without human intervention

⚡ BIGGEST CHALLENGES:
• Sensor calibration (weeks debugging electromagnetic interference)
• Power management (ESP32 crashes → dual-controller solution)
• Memory optimization (10KB HTML → 1KB redesign)
• WiFi connectivity (college networks → mobile hotspot solution)

� HUGE THANKS TO NEPATHYA COLLEGE:
Vice-Principal Shiva Bhattarai sir personally drove our project to competition in his car! College supported us economically & emotionally. We worked 6 AM-9 PM in classrooms daily.

🌍 REAL IMPACT:
This could protect thousands of families in flood-prone areas. We've open-sourced everything for global communities.
